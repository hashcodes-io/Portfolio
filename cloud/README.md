# 🚧 Under Construction — (Temporary) 🚧

Hey — thanks for dropping by!  
This repo is currently a cozy little construction site: scaffolding up, paint cans strewn about, and a very determined engineer (that’s me) muttering at their keyboard. I’m working on pushing everything from my local machine to this repo as soon as I can carve out time between coffee breaks and debugging adventures.

> **TL;DR:** Things are being built. I will push the changes from local → this repo when I get the time. No exact ETA — but progress is happening. 🛠️☕️

---

## Why the wait?
Because quality > chaos:
- I prefer pushing tidy commits and working demos (so `pattern-miner` doesn't explode).  
- It takes time to document properly (my way).  
- Plus: real life — meetings, research, and the occasional urge to sleep.

## Want to see something *right now*?
- Email me directly: `hashaamahsan@gmail.com` — I’ll prioritize by demand.

## How I’ll push (for the curious)
When I push, expect tidy commits and a little bit of celebration:
```bash
# from my local machine
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add README + pattern miner example"
git push origin main
